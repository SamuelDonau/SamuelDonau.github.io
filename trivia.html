    <h1>Trivia</h1>
    <p>It was revealed in an interview with Nintendo's president, Satoru Iwata, that Masahiro Sakurai had intended for Final Smashes to be included in the original Super Smash Bros. He claims that he has proof in the form of recorded voices for when characters used their Final Smash. Hacking into the debug menu of the game, Ness's and Captain Falcon's voice clips for final smashes. But there also exist voice clips for Pikachu, Kirby, and Fox that might have been intended for final smashes as well. The idea, however, was never actually implemented until Brawl due to software issues.</p>
<p>Super Smash Bros. was originally going to be a game named "Dragon King: The Fighting Game" for the Nintendo 64, and only featured placeholder characters. According to the wife of Masahiro Sakurai, Michiko Sakurai, the "in-house" nickname for Dragon King was "Pepsi Man".</p>
<p>Although never acknowledged by Sakurai or any developers behind Super Smash Bros., third party sources have identified Namco's 1995 fighting game The Outfoxies as a possible inspiration, with Sakurai also crediting the idea of making a beginner-friendly fighting game to an experience in which he handily defeated a couple of casual gamers on The King of Fighters '95 in an arcade.</p>
<p>The starting eight characters are placed in the order of when they first appeared in their respective titles on the character selection screen, starting with the oldest, Mario and Donkey Kong, and leading to the most recent, Pikachu.</p>
<p>When a character is chosen, they perform a brief animation in their player's display box below the character-select array. This is the only game in the series to have this feature.</p>
<p>In the credits, Charles Martinet, the voice of Mario and Luigi, was misspelled as "Charles Martinee".</p>
<p>In Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl, the characters are trophies that have been brought to life, as demonstrated in their intro sequences and continue screens. This is not the case in Super Smash Bros., in which the characters are instead toys that have been brought to life by Master Hand, and the stages are dioramas.
The Japanese Version lacks the "Congratulations" screen when you complete 1 player mode.</p>
<p>The Japanese Version also has completely different sound effects for the hitting of the characters, which are much more realistic like those in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl and other arcade fighting games. This was probably a change done to make the game's sound effects more exaggerated and less realistic to be consistent with the cartoony violence and unrealistic environments/characters the game consisted of. Some speculate, however, that this was actually done for censorship reasons.</p>
<p>The narrator also says "Fox" in a different tone than the Western version, and he says "Battle Royal" instead of "Free-for-all". In the Western versions, the re-recorded voices have a slightly different echo effect than the Japanese original.
In the European version of the game, when set to the German Language, the German announcer does not say "Captain Falcon" or "Team Battle" in German.</p>
<p>Some items (excluding battering items and containers) and all Pokémon are actually 2D sprites.</p>
<p>It's absolutely impossible (without hacking) to clear all the eight digits on the counter that tells how many points the player has earned in 1P Mode.
This is the only game in the series to receive a rating of E for everyone. Its sequels Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl are both rated T for teen, while Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate are rated E10+.
This is the only game to exclusively feature Nintendo's heroes. Future installments included playable villains (Bowser, Ganondorf, etc.).</p>
<p>The playable characters are all veterans that return in future Super Smash Bros. installments.
The Mario and Pokémon universe are the only universes to have more than one playable character in this game. The Yoshi and F-Zero universes have only one playable character in all iterations of Super smash Bros.
In the Japanese version, Mario and Luigi have slightly larger heads than in any other version.</p>
<p>Samus is the only female playable character. Nine characters are male, including: Mario, Donkey Kong, Link, Yoshi, Kirby, Fox, Luigi, Captain Falcon and Ness. Pikachu and Jigglypuff have not been confirmed to be male or female.
This game actually allows the player to fight characters in Classic Mode that have not been unlocked yet (Luigi is teamed up with Mario in the 2v2).</p>
<p>The playable characters in the original Super Smash Bros. are all starter characters in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. Ness and Jigglypuff are unlockable characters in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS.
Super Smash Bros. is the only game to show all the unlockable characters in the intro, being Luigi, Captain Falcon, Ness, and Jigglypuff.</p>
<p>There was supposed to have a Racing Mini Game, but it was scrapped.</p>
<p>Super Smash Bros. was meant for a Christmas release in December 1998, but was pushed to 1999 for unknown reasons. As the final build of the Japanese version of the game was dated 12/11/1998. (Source: The Cutting Room Floor and SourceGaming).
In the intro video the Pokémon Trainer that is walking by Pikachu is possibly was Ash Ketchum from the Pokémon anime series. The Trainer's shoes closely matches of Ash's shoes from the original series.</p>
